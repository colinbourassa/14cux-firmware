This repository contains documents, source code, and tools related to the
embedded code in the Lucas 14CUX engine management computer.

  firmware: Annotated assembly source for the 14CUX firmware itself. The goal
            of this source repository is to provide certain features of the
            firmware as build options, so that they may be included or excluded
            based on user selections. Examples include the road speed limiter
            and modifications made by Land Rover (such as the cold-start fix.)

            Notes: These source modules have been formatted to be compatible
            with CRASM (the open source Motorola cross assembler.) CRASM was
            selected as the assembler of choice to take advantage of a number of
            features such as local-scope labels and conditional-assembly blocks.
            This led to the discovery of a few bugs in CRASM 1.5 that affect the
            instructions SUBD, RTI, and MUL. Version 1.6 (or later) of CRASM is
            required to produce correct binary output. Further stability
            improvements were made after 1.6, so you should get the most recent
            version if possible.

     utils: Supporting utilities that perform tasks such as finalizing a
            firmware image (by balancing its checksum) and converting a
            Motorola s-record file to a binary image.

whitepaper: LaTeX source for a document that describes in detail the design of
            the 14CUX ECU, the programmatic flow of the 14CUX firmware, and the
            software diagnostic protocol used over the ECU's serial port.
