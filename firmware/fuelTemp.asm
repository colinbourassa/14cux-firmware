;   Description:
;       ADC Routine - Fuel Temp Thermistor - Channel 11 (8-bit conversion)
;
;   ADC service routines are entered with the newly measured ADC value in
;   X00C8/C9 (only X00C9 for 8-bit readings). The A accumulator also contains
;   the 8-bit reading.
;
;   Note that for both HO2 sensors the ADC service routine table points to
;   the 'rts' (return from subroutine) at the end of this routine.
;
;
;    From Land Rover Docs:
;
;    Engine Fuel Temperature Sensor (EFTS)
;    The fuel temperature sensor, mounted on the fuel rail, operates in the
;    same manner as the ECTS. When the ECM receives a high fuel temperature
;    input, it increases injector pulse during hot restarts. When fuel is hot,
;    vaporization occurs in the fuel rail and bubbles may be found in the
;    injectors. This can lead to hard starting. Increasing injector pulse time
;    flushes the bubbles away and cools the fuel rail with fresh fuel from the
;    tank. Since 1989, the EFTS has also been used by ECM to trigger operation
;    of the radiator fans when under-hood temperatures become extreme.
;    As with the engine coolant temperature sensor, a diagnostic trouble code
;    (15 [14CUX only]) is stored when the signal is out of range (0.08V to 4.9V)
;    for longer than 160 milliseconds. No default value is provided by the ECM,
;    however the MIL will illuminate.
;
;   Note about sensor limits.
;   When checking the range of the EFT counts, the addition of $04 
;   checks for exceeded limits at both ends of the sensor. For example,
;   adding $04 and checking for a minimum of $08 checks for a low count
;   minimum of $04 but it also checks for a high count maximum of $FC which
;   is -4 in two's complement, since the value would wrap and look like a
;   small positive number.
