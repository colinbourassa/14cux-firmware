;   Description:
;       ADC Routine - Air Flow Sensor - Channel 2 (10-bit conversion)
;
;   ADC service routines are entered with the newly measured ADC value in
;   X00C8/C9 (only X00C9 for 8-bit readings). The A accumulator also contains
;   the 8-bit reading from location X00C9.
;
;   This routine simply stores the high and low readings from the air flow
;   sensor. Besides the main MAF signal being handled here, ADC channel 9 can
;   store the MAF trim voltage measurment (open loop only).
