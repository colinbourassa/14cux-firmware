;   Description:
;       ADC Routine - Air flow sensor - Channel 9 (10-bit conversion)
;
;   ADC service routines are entered with the newly measured ADC value in
;   X00C8/C9 (only X00C9 for 8-bit readings). The A accumulator also contains
;   the 8-bit reading.
;
;   This ADC routine is only called by open loop fuel maps (1, 2 and 3). It
;   measures the MAF CO trim voltage and stores the ADC count in the memory
;   locations normally used by the long-term Lambda trim. It appears that
;   nothing more is done with the data than provide a means for reading the
;   trim voltage through the serial port.
