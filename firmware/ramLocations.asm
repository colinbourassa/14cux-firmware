;   Description:    RAM Variables
;
;   There are two areas of RAM.
;
;   MPU: $0040 to $00FF  (192 bytes)
;   PAL: $2000 to $20FF  (128 bytes)
;
;   Of the MPU's 192 bytes of RAM, the first 32 bytes are battery-backed or
;   preserved using a small amount of battery current. Of these 32 bytes, only
;   the first 20 bytes are actually used in this way, the remainder is treated
;   like normal RAM and cleared to zero on startup.
;
;   It should be noted that the MPU internal memory is actually faster than
;   the external PAL memory. This is because the internal memory can be
;   accessed using direct addressing instead of extended addressing. See the
;   Motorola documentation for more info on this.
