;   Description:    Purge Valve Interrupt
;
;   This is Output Compare Interrupt 2 (OCF2 Interrupt) for the 6803U4.
;
;   H02S = Heated Oxygen Sensor
;   This interrupt is triggered when the Output Compare Register 2 (OCR2)
;   matches the free running clock. It seems when X00E2.4 is set, purge valve
;   is turned OFF by interrupt. The actual value is 1720 not 1700 RPM.
;
;   Besides this interrupt, there are two subroutines having to do with the
;   purge valve. One is called from the ECT subroutine. The other is called
;   from two places in the ICI.
;
;   Note that even though the microprocessor's non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
;   is not used, the NMI vector points to the 'rti' instruction at the end
;   of this routine (simply for good coding practice).
;
;   From Land Rover Docs:
;
;   The ECM pulses the valve open for short periods below 1700 RPM and holds
;   it open at higher speeds once the engine has achieved operating temperature
;   and is in closed loop. Operating temperature is defined as engine coolant
;   temperature above 54 C (130 F).
;
;   The ECM monitors the need for canister purge by looking at HO2S response
;   when the valve is opened. No change in HO2S response with the valve open
;   indicates that the canister has been purged of fuel vapor and continued
;   valve operation is no longer necessary. Operation of the purge function
;   when no longer required can negatively impact vehicle emissions.
