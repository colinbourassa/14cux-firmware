;   Description:    16-Bit Multiply Routine
;
;   The MPU has an 8-bit multiply instruction (mul) which multiplies the
;   accumulators (A and B) into a 16-bit value (AB) but software often needs
;   to multiply 16-bit numbers. This multiplies the 16-bits stored at AB with
;   the 16-bits stored at general purpose memory locations X00CA/CB. Only the
;   top 16-bits of the 32-bit result is returned in AB.
;
;   In the standard code build, this routine is found immediatley after the
;   RPM table and before the reset entry point.
