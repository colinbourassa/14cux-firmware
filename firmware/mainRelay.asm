;   Description:
;       ADC Routine - Main Relay Sense - Channel 8 (8-bit conversion)
;
;   ADC service routines are entered with the newly measured ADC value in
;   X00C8/C9 (only X00C9 for 8-bit readings). The A accumulator also contains
;   the 8-bit reading.
;
;   The raw ADC value is not saved in RAM. The raw value is used in a
;   calculation and the result is saved. The value in RAM goes up as
;   the voltage goes down. Here is the formula:
;
;        Y = ( (100)X^2 - (189)X  +  25608 ) / 4
;
;   Typically, the value starts around 1200 to 1400 (approx 12.6V) with
;   power on, spikes to around 2000 during cranking (low voltage) and settles
;   to around 900 to 950 (running voltage of 13+). The calculated value is
;   the last phase of compensation during fueling calculation.
;
;   It seems that if road speed is high, the voltage reading is saved as is,
;   but if the road speed is low, the reading is only altered by 1 count per
;   call.
