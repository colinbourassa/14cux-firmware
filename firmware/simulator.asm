;   14CUX Firmware Rebuild Project
;
;   File Date: 14-Nov-2013
;
;   Description:    Simulator Code
;
;   This module is optionally added to the 14CUX code by turning on the
;   SIMULATION_MODE bit. In addition to adding this code, the SIMULATION_MODE
;   does the following:
;
;   1) Deletes the copying of 19 bytes of memory from the battery-backed area
;       to external RAM locations $2060 through $2072. Other code which checks
;       and updates this external memory is also deleted. This RAM area is then
;       free for use by the simulator.
;
;   2) The RAM area ($2060-$2072) can now be written with prepared simulation
;       values, prior to turning simulation mode On. This is done through the
;       normal serial port interface using the write command.
;
;   3) Simulation mode is turned ON by writing $55 to location $2072.
;
;   4) When simulation mode is active, the 'simulation' subroutine (below) is
;       immediatley called right after the main loop ADC measurment is made.
;       This replaces the actual measured value with one from the RAM area.
;
;   5) In addition, 4 other ADC measurements are be made from the ICI. Here is
;       how they are handled:
;               TPS Measurement -- uses in-line simulation code
;               MAF Measurement -- uses in-line simulation code
;               HO2 Measurement -- both L & R call 'o2Simulation' below
;
;   In combination with 2 function generators, this allows full simulation
;   of any scenario.
;
;   One function generator is needed to simulate the engine spark. This needs
;   to be a pulse generator with a greater than TTL output and probably an
;   external booster transformer.
;
;   The second function generator is for the road speed (VSS) input signal to
;   the ECU. A 12 volt square wave is ideal, although a 7 Volt waveform should
;   work. TTL level will work if the threshold in the software is lowered.
;
;   This describes use of the simulation RAM area. All values are 8-bit unless
;   otherwise noted.
;
;   $2060    = inertia switch
;   $2061    = heated screen
;   $2062/63 = air flow (10 bits)
;   $2064/65 = throttle pot (10 bits)
;   $2066    = coolant temp
;   $2067    = neutral switch
;   $2068    = air cond load
;   $2069    = road speed
;   $206A    = main relay
;   $206B    = air idle trim
;   $206C    = tune resistor
;   $206D    = fuel temp
;   $206E    = left O2
;   $206F    = O2 reference
;   $2070    = diag plug
;   $2071    = right O2
;   $2072    = control word (00 = OFF, 55 = ON)
;
;
;   Simulator Timeline:
;       Toggling 4004.4 to frame ICI = 10 + 10 = 20 clocks
;       Code block that toggles 4004.7 = 21 or 24 clocks
;       Main loop call to simulator2 = 41 to 59 clocks
;       Code Block 9000 = 127 clocks
;
;       Skipping the 4004.7 code will balance the 4004.4 toggle.
;       Skipping the 9000 code will balance 2 to 3 main loop ADC calls.

;                       Main Simulation Routine
;
;   If code was built with SIMULATION_MODE turned on (non-zero), this routine
;   is called immediately after the main loop ADC measurement is made.
;
;   Coming in to this routine, B accumulator is the ADC channel number (0 - F),
;   and X (index register) is #adcVectors location. Both of these registers
;   need to be preserved. The A accumulator does not need to be preserved.
;
;   "simulation2" is an attempt to balance the clock cycles for more even
;   loading so that compensation elsewhere is more effective.
;
;   Clock cycles:   add [6] for jsr (extended)
;
;   MAF: 9 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 19 + 6 = 41
;   TPS: 9 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 19 + 6 = 41
;   < 2: 9 + 5     + 34     + 6 = 54
;   > 3: 9 + 5 + 5 + 34     + 6 = 59

;   The 8-bit value needs to be higher than the O2 reference to be recognized
