;   Description:    RPM Table
;
;   This table sets up the RPM brackets for the fuel map. Ignition period is
;   measured by the microprocessor and stored as a 16-bit number. The period
;   is measured in 1 uSec increments but is divided by 2 and stored in 2 uSec
;   units. The first two columns in the table are the 16-bit ignition period
;   brackets and the right two columns tell the software how to interpolate
;   the remainder.
;
;   If editing this table, it's important to make sure that the interpolation
;   values are correct for a smoothly changing curve.
